# Convolutional Networks

## Deep learning Chapter 9 

### Efficient Convolution Algorithm

**Separable Kernel**: A kernel can be expressed as the outer product of $d$ vectors, one vector per dimension.

### Random or Unsupervised Features

"One way to reduce the cost of convolutional network training is to use features that are not reained in a supervised fashion"

3 basic strategies for obtaining convolution kernels without supervised training.

1. Initialize randomly
2. Design by hand
3. Learn the kernels with an unsupervised criterion
